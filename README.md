# <03 JavaScript: Password Generator>

## Description

I modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Clicking the button to generate a password will present a series of prompts for password criteria.
When prompted for password criteria select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the password length choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for the types of characters to include in the password, confirm whether or not it should include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When responding to each prompt at least one type of character must be selected.
When all prompts are answered, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated it will be displayed on the page.
