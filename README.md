# Password Generator

## Description

I modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Clicking the button to generate a password will present a series of prompts for password criteria.
When prompted for password criteria select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the password length choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for the types of characters to include in the password, confirm whether or not it should include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When responding to each prompt at least one type of character must be selected.
When all prompts are answered, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated it will be displayed on the page.
